# _Anteater_

A tool for drawing and creating animations for the terminal...in the terminal. 

Currently the UI is the main focus, but in the future I hope to add features such as brushes (with brush size)

# Current Keybinds (subject to change):
- right arrow: next frame
- left arrow: last frame
- d: enter draw mode (lets you actually draw stuff)
- e: erase (enter erase mode)
- r: reset mode
- l: clear current frame
- o: export/render the animation
- z: undo
- Shift + z (Z): redo
- c: change the current character you're drawing with
- s: change the current color you're drawing with
- space: play
- o: export file (render)
- s: save file
- i: import file
- Drag with right click: select
- y: copy
- p: paste
- Ctrl + a: select all
- Shift + d (D): deselect
