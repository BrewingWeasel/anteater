# _Anteater_

Anteater is a tool for creating drawings and animations in the terminal. Anteater is written in python using curses and has no external dependencies. Anteater was built with linux in mind, but it should work on other unix systems.
# Running:
Note that in order to use Anteater, it is *highly* recommended to set your "term" environment variable to xterm-1003. For example, ```export TERM=xterm-1003```

A reddit post with a sample video of the project can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/zq62yv/oc_i_made_a_tool_to_create_custom_animations_in/) (The video is too big to upload)
