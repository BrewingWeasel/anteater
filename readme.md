# _Anteater_

A tool for drawing and creating animations for the terminal...in the terminal. 

Drawing and animation are both fully working with colors. However the experience isn't great due to the lack of things like custom brushes and floodfill.

Keybinds:
- right arrow: next frame
- left arrow: last frame
- d: enter draw mode (lets you actually draw stuff)
- e: erase (enter erase mode)
- l: clear current frame
- o: export/render the animation
- z: undo
- Shift + z (Z): redo
- c: change the current character you're drawing with
- s: chnage the current color you're drawing with
